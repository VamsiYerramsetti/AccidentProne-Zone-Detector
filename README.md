Identified seven accident prone areas in the UK by analyzing UK traffic accident data sets and implementing DBSCAN and K-means clustering.
The project report pdf gives full insight and breakdown of the project.

This project was awarded a 9/10 by the Data-Mining (NWI-IBI008) course teaching team.
Matthijs and I analysed two sets of UK traffic-accident data contatning over 1.6 milion entries and successfully implemented DBSCAN and a custom-desighned K-means clustering algorithm to identify seven areas which are accident-prone. This project was done in a jupyter notbook in python.
